## `ExclusiveLock`

Need to synchronize a bunch of workers so that only 1 does a particular thing?  If yes,
then you need a lock file.  This package uses a cache store (`redis` or `keydb`)
to create records atomically that only 1 instance will "own."

### NOTES

This library covers most common use cases for exclusion when working with multiple instances of the same application / container:

* Exclusive initialization: have one of the application instances perform a task on init.
* Periodic checks: Have one of the application instances perform a task periodically.

For long running tasks and rare edge cases, it could be possible that the lock is perceived as acquired by more than one instance. This library does not provide strict guarantees for exclusion for tasks that must be processed exactly once in a non-idempotent manner (e.g. appending an item in order processing). Consider using upserts/cas on your persistent DB in those cases or using a dedicated solution for exclusion like etcd / zookeeper.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @logdna/exclusive-lock --save
```

## Usage

```js
const ExclusiveLock = require('@logdna/exclusive-lock')
const cache_connection = require('./my-keydb-connection.js')
const pino = require('pino')

const exclusive_lock = new ExclusiveLock({
  name: 'my-distributed-app'
, log: pino()
, cache_manager
})

async function main() {
  const acquired = await exclusive_lock.acquire()
  if (acquired) {
    log.info('You win the race! Lock acquired')
  }
  exclusive_lock.release()
}

main()
```

## Auto-refreshing
As a feature, `exclusive-lock` will start a timer to automatically refresh the TTL on
the lock file, as it's assumed that the lock holder will always want to hold the lock
until explicitly released. This feature is handled by a `setInterval` timer and can
encouter errors asynchronously.  See the [`error`](#error) event for details on that.

* The timer is not started until a lock is successfully [`acquired`](#acquire).
* For clean shutdown, always [`release()`](#release) an acquired lock so that the timer is canceled.
* [`refreshed`](#refreshed) is emitted for every successful refresh.

## API

-------

### `new ExclusiveLock(options)`
* `options` [`<Object>`][]
  * `name` [`<String>`][] - **Required** A unique string to identify your application
  * `cache_connection` [`<Object>`][] - **Required** A connection to the cache, either Redis or Keydb
  * `log` [`<Object>`][] - A optional logger instance such as `pino`. Must support levels `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`. **Default: [abstract-logging](https://www.npmjs.com/package/abstract-logging)**
  * `lock_ttl_ms` [`<Number>`][] - Optional. Specify a TTL in milliseconds for the   lock.  **Default: 3000**
  * `lock_refres_ms` [`<Number>`][] - Optional. specify a time in milliseconds for refreshing the lock on an interval. **Default: 1000**
  * `lock_contents` [`<String>`][] - Optional. Specify the string contents to put in the lock file, e.g. a server/instance name.

  Throws: [`<Error>`][] for validation errors

### `acquire()`

Attempts to exclusively acquire a lock based on the given `name`. If multiple
instances are competing, only 1 will win the lock.

Returns: `Promise<Boolean>` if the lock was a success \
Emits: [`acquired`](#acquired)

### `inspect()`

Returns the contents of the lock. Useful if `lock_contents` was used to store
valuable information in the lock.

Returns: `Promise<Object|Number|Boolean|String>` The contents of the lock

### `release()`

Unlock based on `name`.  Idempotent.  Instances that do not have the lock will
be a no-op.

Returns: `Promise<undefined>` \
Emits: [`released`](#released)

## Events

### `'acquired'`

* `key` [`<String>`][] - The key value of the lock stored in cache

This event is emitted after a successful lock is acquired. Because the [`acquire()`](#acquire)
method is `async`, there's no real need to listen for this, but it has been added
to remain consistent with the [`'released'`](#released) event which can happen asynchronously.

### `'refreshed'`

* [`<Object>`][] - The payload object
  * `key` [`<String>`][] - The key value of the lock stored in cache
  * `lock_ttl_ms` [`<Number>`][] - The TTL value that it was refreshed to

This event is emitted after a lock's TTL is successfully refreshed.

### `'released'`

* `key` [`<String>`][] - The key value of the lock stored in cache

This event is emitted when a lock is released.

### `'error'`

* `err` [`<Error>`][] - A thrown error that occurred

This event is thrown when errors are encountered in the TTL refresh timer. In this
case, the error is emitted and the following actions are taken:

* [`release()`](#release) will automatically be called. This is so that the lock does
  not become expired leaving the lock holder thinking that it's still acquired. Users
  should listen for these events and act accordingly.
* If the above `release()` also fails, an `'error'` event will be emitted again with
  those details. At that point, the instance will no longer think the lock is acquired, but its record will remain until the TTL expires. This is because the failure in `release()` will be because of a failed `cache.del()` operation, thus
  leaving the key.
